## Networking

Some examples configure networking. By default, they will listen on a static
IPv4 address. Be sure to configure the host computer end of the network
accordingly.

The default IPv4 address the test examples will configure is `10.42.0.61`.
You can configure the other end like this:

    $ ip address add 10.42.0.1/24 dev <INTERFACE>
    $ ip link set up dev <INTERFACE>

To double-check that the address has indeed be added, you can use:

    $ ip address show dev <INTERFACE>

Replace `<INTERFACE>` with the name of the used network interface.
To find out the name of your interface you can use a command such as `ifconfig`.

For *USB Ethernet*, ensure that in addition to the USB cable used for flashing
and debugging, the USB device port is also connected to the host computer with
a second cable.

For *WiFi* (default on `rpi-pico-w` and the esp32 based boards), the actual WiFi
network credentials have to be supplied via environment variables:

    $ CONFIG_WIFI_NETWORK=<ssid> CONFIG_WIFI_PASSWORD=<pwd> laze build ...

In order to make the device use a DHCP client instead of the static address,
remove the `override-network-config` feature from `Cargo.toml` of the example.
