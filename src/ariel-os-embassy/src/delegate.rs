/// [`Delegate`]s or lends an object to another task.
///
/// This struct can be used to lend a `&mut T` to another task on the same executor.
/// The other task can then call a closure on it. After that, the `&mut T` is returned
/// to the original task.
///
/// Under the hood, [`Delegate`] leverages [`SendCell`] to ensure the delegated
/// object stays on the same executor.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// # use ariel_os_embassy::delegate::Delegate;
/// static SOME_VALUE: Delegate<u32> = Delegate::new();
///
/// // in some task
/// async fn foo() {
///   let mut my_val = 0u32;
///   // SAFETY: `lend` is only called once.
///   unsafe { SOME_VALUE.lend(&mut my_val).await; }
///   assert_eq!(my_val, 1);
/// }
///
/// // in some other task
/// async fn bar() {
///   SOME_VALUE.with(|val| *val = 1).await;
/// }
/// ```
// TODO: this is a PoC implementation.
// - Takes 25Â B for each delegate (on arm), which seems too much.
