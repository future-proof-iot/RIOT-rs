//! Multi-threading for Ariel OS.
//!
//! Implements a scheduler based on fixed priorities and preemption.
//! Within one priority level, threads are scheduled cooperatively.
//! This means that there is no time slicing that would equally distribute CPU time among same-priority threads.
//! **Instead, you need to use [`yield_same()`] to explicitly yield to another thread with the same priority.**
//! If no thread is ready, the core is prompted to enter deep sleep until a next thread is ready.
//!
//! Threads should be implemented using the `ariel_os_macros::thread` proc macro, which takes care
//! of calling the necessary initialization methods and linking the thread function element it into the binary.
//! A [`ThreadId`] between 0 and [`THREADS_NUMOF`] is assigned to each thread in the order in
//! which the threads are declared.
//!
//! Optionally, the stacksize and a priority between 1 and [`SCHED_PRIO_LEVELS`] can be configured.
//! By default, the stack size is 2048 bytes and priority is 1.
//!
//! # Synchronization
//!
//! The `threading` module supports three basic synchronization primitives:
//! - [`Channel`](sync::Channel): synchronous (blocking) channel for sending data between threads
//! - [`Lock`](sync::Lock): basic locking object
//! - [`thread_flags`]: thread-flag implementation for signaling between threads
