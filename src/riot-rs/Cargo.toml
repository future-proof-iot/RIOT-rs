#! ## System functionality
## Enables GPIO interrupt support.

  "dep:riot-rs-threads",
  "riot-rs-rt/threading",
  "riot-rs-embassy/threading",
]
## Enables the internal executor's timer queue, required for timer support.

## Enables the [`random`] module.
random = ["riot-rs-random"]
## Enables a cryptographically secure random number generator in the [`random`] module.
csprng = ["riot-rs-random/csprng"]
## Enables seeding the random number generator from hardware.
hwrng = ["riot-rs-embassy/hwrng"]

#! ## Network protocols
## Enables support for TCP.
tcp = ["riot-rs-embassy/tcp"]
## Enables support for UDP.
udp = ["riot-rs-embassy/udp"]
## Enables support for [CoAP](https://future-proof-iot.github.io/RIOT-rs/dev/docs/book/tooling/coap.html).

## Enables SPI support.
spi = ["riot-rs-embassy/spi"]
## Enables USB support.
usb = ["riot-rs-embassy/usb"]
## Enables USB HID support.
usb-hid = ["riot-rs-embassy/usb-hid"]

#! ## System configuration
#! The [`macro@config`] attribute macro allows to provide configuration for
#! specific system functionality.
#! The features below need to be enabled so that the provided custom
#! configuration is taken into account.
## Enables custom network configuration.
override-network-config = ["riot-rs-embassy/override-network-config"]
## Enables custom USB configuration.
override-usb-config = ["riot-rs-embassy/override-usb-config"]

#! ## Multicore functionality
## Enables support for core affinities (restricting threads to specific cores).
core-affinity = ["multi-core", "riot-rs-threads?/core-affinity"]
#! Exactly one of the features below must be enabled at once.
#! Selection of these should be done through laze configuration.
## Enables one single core, even if the hardware provides multiple cores.
single-core = ["riot-rs-rt/single-core"]
## Enables support for SMP.
multi-core = ["riot-rs-threads?/multi-core", "riot-rs-rt/multi-core"]

#! ## Network type selection
#! At most one of the features below can be enabled at once.
#! These features are normally automatically selected by
#! [laze](https://github.com/kaspar030/laze) based on what the board supports,
#! and don't need to be selected manually.
## Selects Ethernet over USB (USB CDC-NCM).
usb-ethernet = ["riot-rs-embassy/usb-ethernet"]
## Selects Wi-Fi (with the CYW43 chip).
wifi-cyw43 = ["riot-rs-embassy/wifi-cyw43"]
## Selects Wi-Fi (on ESP chips).
wifi-esp = ["riot-rs-embassy/wifi-esp"]

#! ## Development and debugging
## Enables the debug console, required to use
## [`println!`](riot_rs_debug::println).
debug-console = ["riot-rs-rt/debug-console"]
## Enables logging support through `defmt`.

## Enables benchmarking facilities.
bench = ["dep:riot-rs-bench"]
## Prints nothing in case of panics (may help reduce binary size).
silent-panic = ["riot-rs-rt/silent-panic"]
## Allows to have no boards selected, useful to run target-independent tooling.
no-boards = ["riot-rs-boards/no-boards", "executor-none"]

net = ["riot-rs-embassy/net"]

#! ## Executor type selection for the (autostarted) main executor
#! Exactly one of the features below must be enabled at once.
## Enables the interrupt executor.
executor-interrupt = ["riot-rs-embassy/executor-interrupt"]
## Enables the single thread-mode executor.
executor-single-thread = ["riot-rs-embassy/executor-single-thread"]
## Enables the riot-rs-threading thread executor.
executor-thread = ["riot-rs-embassy/executor-thread", "threading"]
# Don't start any executor automatically.
# *Used for internal testing only.*
executor-none = ["riot-rs-embassy/executor-none"]
