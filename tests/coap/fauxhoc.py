fake-it-until-you-make-it wrapper for sending an EDHOC+OSCORE request

Its first stage did roughly

~~~
$ ./aiocoap-client 'coap://10.42.0.61/.well-known/edhoc' -m POST --content-format application/cbor-seq --payload "[true, 3, 2, h'0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000', 0]"
~~~

and the later guessed the C_R and sent a garbled OSCORE request that triggered
the EDHOC CoAP pathways.

Now it does EDHOC using lakers to a point where the name doesn't fit any moreâ€¦
